### TabulAI – A Trend Analysis Tool for Artificial Intelligence (AI)
Bachelor project conducted in collaboration with SINTEF, conceived as a proof of concept (POC) within the larger enRichMyData[^1] initiative, and specifically under the InnoGraph[^2] business case. The project's goal was to develop an interactive web application to analyse and visualize trends in AI research. Data was cleaned and preprocessed using **Python**, then  **vectorization** and **similarity search** techniques were used to tag academic articles with the most relevant AI topics from a pre-prepared taxonomy. Dynamic visualizations were created using **Streamlit**. TabulAI provides researchers, policymakers and investors with valuable insight into AI trends.

Feedback from the project supervisor highlighted key aspects of the project's success:

> The project met the requirements, especially given its research and exploratory nature, with changing requirements during the project period. ... The project was essential to the InnoGraph business case in enRichMyData and served as the first concrete prototype to demonstrate the utility of the chosen technology stack and its adaptability to different data sources. The developed prototype will be used as a demonstrator in enRichMyData, to be reused and extended with new source datasets.

The project will be presented at the [ACM KDD 2024 European Data Science Day](https://aile3.ijs.si/dunja/EU-Day-KDD2024/index.html) on 27 August in Barcelona.

### Is it possible to accurately classify a person as being diabetic, prediabetic or non-diabetic based upon survey responses?
Final project for the subject DATA3800 Introduction to Data Science with Scripting as part of my studies at OsloMet. I devised the research question and attempted to answer it using an open-source dataset from Kaggle. Data was cleaned and analysed using **Python**, and a **clustering** algorithm (K-Modes) was used to try to discover distinct groups within the data. Although I was unable to definitively answer the question within the timeframe of the project, I reflected on the results obtained and suggested further avenues for exploration.
